# Adjustable TicTacToe Game Written in C
A project I made during the intruductory course to programming in C at the Department of Information Systems at the University of Haifa.

**My code has been graded 100/100.**

It demonstrates usage of dynamic memory allocation and two-dimentional arrays in the C programming language. 

The code itself is within the .c file, with a precompiled executable also available alongside. Hebrew instructions included in the pdf document.
